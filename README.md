## Prerequisits:
- USB-Serial Converter based on FTDI chip
- USB-Serial converter must be connected to COM1 on Fröling mainboard
- A Linux based operating system is required

# Installation by package (actually available for Raspian Buster)

## install
```
wget www.jwendel.de/p4d/install-deb.sh -O /tmp/install-deb.sh
sudo bash /tmp/install-deb.sh
```

## uninstall
`dpkg --remove p4d`

## uninstall (with remove of all configurations, data and the p4d database)
`dpkg --purge p4d`

# Installation by source (working for most linux plattforms)

## Preliminary:
Update your package data:
`sudo apt update`
and, if you like, update your installation:
`sudo apt dist-upgrade`

## Prerequisits:
-  the described installation is tested with Raspbian buster, the p4d should work also with other Linux distributions and versions but the installation process should adapted to them, for example they use other init processes
   or use different tools for the package management, other package names, ....
- de_DE.UTF-8 is required as language package (Raspberry command: `dpkg-reconfigure locales`)

## Install libwebsockets (https://github.com/warmcat/libwebsockets)
  at least version 4.1 or above
  you can clone it from git at https://libwebsockets.org/repo/libwebsockets


## Installation of the MariaDb Database:
It's not required to host the database on the Raspberry. A remote database is supported as well!
Perform all the following steps as root user! Either by getting root or by prefix each command with sodo.

`apt install mariadb-server`

(set database password for root user during installation)

### Local database setup:
If the database server is located localy on same host as the p4d:

```
> mysql -u root -Dmysql -p
  CREATE DATABASE p4 charset utf8;
  CREATE USER 'p4'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4';
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON p4.* TO 'p4'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4';
  flush privileges;
```
### Remote database setup:
if the database is running remote (on a other host or you like to habe remote access):
```
> mysql -u root -Dmysql -p
 CREATE DATABASE p4 charset utf8;
 CREATE USER 'p4'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON p4.* TO 'p4'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'p4';
 flush privileges;
```

### Install and enable mosquitto
```
apt install mosquitto
systemctl start mosquitto
systemctl enable mosquitto
```
#### if you like to ceck mosquitto or use it from scripts install mosquitto client package
```
install mosquitto-clients
```

## Installation of the p4d daemon:
### install the build dependencies
```
apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev libjansson-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libmariadb-dev uuid-dev libcap-dev liblua5.3-dev libsystemd-dev
```

### get the p4d and build it
```
cd /usr/src/
git clone https://github.com/horchi/linux-p4d/
cd linux-p4d
make clean all
make install
```
#### For older linux distributions which don't support the systemd init process use this instead of 'make install'
```
make install INIT_SYSTEM=sysV
```
#### If you like a other destination than '/usr/local' append PREFIX=your-destination (e.g. PREFIX=/usr) to all make calls above

- Now P4 daemon is installed in folder `/usr/local/bin` and its config in /etc/p4d/
- Check `/etc/p4d/daemon.conf` file for setting db connection papameters,
- after starting and connecting the web interface set the proper tty device in the setup menu

## Time to first start of p4d
```
systemctl start p4d
```
### to check it's state call
```
systemctl status p4d
```
it should now 'enabled' and in state 'running'!

### also check the syslog about errors of the p4d, this will show all its current log messages
```
grep "p4d:" /var/log/syslog
```

## Aggregation / Cleanup
The samples will recorded in the configured interval (at the setup page), the default is 60 Seconds.
After a while the database will grow and the selects become slower. Therefore you can setup a automatic aggregation by adjusting 'Historie' and 'Danach aggregieren über'

A 'Historie' of 365 means that all samples older than 365 days will be aggregated to one sample per ''Danach aggregieren über' minutes (for example 15 minutes)
If you like to completely delete 'old' samples you have to do the cleanup job by hand, actually I don't see the need to delete anything, I like to hold my data (forever :) ?).

## WEB interface:

The default port of the WEB interface is 1111, The default username and password for the login is
User: *p4*
Pass: *p4*

### Fist steps to enable data logging:

1. Log in to the web interface
2. Goto Setup -> Commands
  - click 'Init Sensors'
3. Goto Setup -> IO Setup
  - Select the values you like to record and store your selection (click 'Speichern')
4. Goto Setup -> Commands
  - click 'Init Service Menü'

After this you can set up the schema configuration. The schema configuration is done by drag&drop and isn't working on mobile devices!
Also deleting of chart bookmarks isn't supported on mobile devices.

### Setup and configure sending mails:
The next steps are an example to setup the sending of mails. If another tool is preferred it can be used as well.
- Install required components
  - `apt-get install bsd-mailx msmtp msmtp-mta`
- The mailscript `p4d-mail.sh` is copied during the `make install` to the folder `/usr/local/bin`. This script is used in our case to send mails
- Setup your mail account in `/etc/msmtprc`

- Start the WEBIF and Login, go to the Setup page
- Configure the "Mail Benachrichtigungen" options (status and Fehler Mail Empfänger)
- If no Status options are set you will get a mail for each status change
- Set the script option `/usr/local/bin/p4d-mail.sh`

If the heating values are added as attachment to the mail please check the next steps.
- Check if `heirloom-mailx` is installed (`ls -lah /etc/alternatives/mail`)
- If output link is `/etc/alternatives/mail -> /usr/bin/mail.mailutils`
- Remove `heirloom-mailx` (`apt remove heirloom-mailx`)

### Configure Time sync:
With the next steps you can enable a time synchronization of the p4d and the heating:
If you enable this feature you can set the max time difference between the p4d systemtime and the time of the heating. The p4d will set the time of the heating (once a day) to his the systemtime. Therefore it is recommended to hold your system time in sync, e.g. by running the `ntp` daemon or systemd-timesyncd.

- Check if ntpd (openntpd, systemd-timesyncd, ...) is active and running. If not you have to install one of it.
- Start the WEBIF and login, go to the Setup page
- Enable "Tägliche Zeitsynchronisation" and set the max time difference in seconds in the line "Maximale Abweichung"
- Save configuration

### MQTT Interface

Configure the parameters at the WEBIF
- 'MQTT Url' : The URL of your MQTT broker
- 'MQTT Data Topic Name' : The name of the topic which should be written. You can use the '&lt;NAME&gt;' template here, this will be replaced by the name of the sensor, therefore one topic for each sensor will be created and used (as needed by the homeassistant). If you (e.g.) using Openhab or FHEM omit '&lt;NAME&gt;' and all data is written to one topic.
                           The '&lt;GROUP&gt;' template, will use the configured group name and sort the sensors regarding its group configuration to the topics. Don't use the GROUP and NAME template together!
- 'Config Topic:' : Check box to write the sensor defaults to a config topic and register the separate config topics there (as used by the homeassistant).

### One Wire Sensors:
The p4d checks automatically if there are 'One Wire Sensors' connected, each detected sensor will be
configurable via the web interface after reading the sensor facts by clicking [init].

To make the sensors availaspble to the raspi you have to load the `w1-gpio` module, this can be done by calling `modprobe w1-gpio` or automatically at boot by registering it in `/etc/modules`:
```
echo "w1-gpio" >> /etc/modules
echo "w1_therm" >> /etc/modules
echo "dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpioin=4,pullup=on" >> /boot/config.txt
```

### Style
You can chose the Web Interface Style at 'Setup' -> 'Allg. Konfiguration' with the options 'Farbschema' and 'Icon Style Set'.
The 'Farbschema' option include all CSS styles which are found in your web folder and fit the naming scheme 'stylesheet-*.css' where the wildcard '*' is used as the name of the style.
The 'Icon Style Set' option includes the name of all suborders of img/state/* in your  web folder. You can place additional custom styles and icon sets which automatically appear in the settings.
The default web folder is /var/lib/p4/.

### Points to check
- reboot the device to check if p4d is starting automatically during startup

## Use https for WEB interface:
 - add your cert and your key to this two files and make sure the p4d has at least read access to this files
   /etc/p4d/p4d.cert
   /etc/p4d/p4d.key
 - enable WebSSL at 'Setup' -> 'Allg. Konfiguration'
 - restart the p4d
 - now access to the web interface is ONLY by https://.. possible

## Backup
Backup the data of the p4 database including all recorded values:

```
p4d-backup.sh
```

This will create a dump file for each table like:

```
<tablename>-dump.sql.gz
```

To import the backup:
```
gunzip NAME-dump.sql.gz
mysql -u p4 -pp4 -Dp4 < *-dump.sql
```

#### Alternative installation using Docker
https://hub.docker.com/r/n3m3515/docker-p4d

#### ATTENTION:
The import deletes at first all the data and then imports the dumped data. To append the dumped data you have to modify the SQL statements inside the dump files manually.

## Additional information

### MariaDb HINTS
If you cannot figure out why you get Access denied, remove all entries from the user table that have Host values with wildcars contained (entries that match `%` or `_` characters). A very common error is to insert a new entry with `Host='%'` and `User='some_user'`, thinking that this allows you to specify localhost to connect from the same machine. The reason that this does not work is that the default privileges include an entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User=''`. Because that entry has a Host value `localhost` that is more specific than `%`, it is used in preference to the new entry when connecting from localhost! The correct procedure is to insert a second entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User='some_user'`, or to delete the entry with `Host='localhost'` and `User=''`. After deleting the entry, remember to issue a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` statement to reload the grant tables.

To analyze this you can show all users:
```
use mysql
SELECT host, user FROM user;
```

## Problems - anything is not working
 - check the syslog an p4d.log about errors of the p4d
 - for the WEBIF check also the browser console for errors
 - check the wiki at github
If you post any problem at at git-hub or the forum please post the errors also!
